# IBSC_FGH
Using the Fourier Grid Hamiltonian Method to describe the optical properties of Intermediate band solar cells composed of quantum wells.

The algorithm was written using Python3 and presented within the file "IntermediateBandSolarCell.ipynb". It is intended to generate the potential profile of an Intermediate Band Solar Cell, composed of an p-i-n semicondutor junction with a quantum in the intrinsec (i) region. Changing the quantum well's properties we can change the optical response and analyse its dependence in comparison to the solar cell emission spectrum.

The code is divided in some parts, that are discribed next.

1) Importing required libraries.
2) Defining system â€™ s properties
3)
